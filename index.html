                    <h3>Origin:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Library's founder, Fat Stoner has decided at some point that not enough information and knowledge is being shared between the users of GGPT. This came about when a larger creator refused to help him in the early days of his bot creation, stating that he keeps his code secret from everyone. Most of the popular bots back-end was under lock and key back then too. He decided to gather a small group of creators consisting of some of the most popular faces on GGPT as well as some GGPT staff to help with this endeavour.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Over time the Library has become larger and larger, hosting more and more creators into it's ranks. Currently we pride ourselves in being a highly curated community of GGPT creators who care for availability of information and knowledge about everything bot building related. We hope you will find the content here accessible and useful in your journey as a bot creator!
