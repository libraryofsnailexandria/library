                        <h2>Character Concept: by GrimTK</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            While we all are eager to get a character published, if you want your character to be more than a flat sex bot, take a moment and think about them. As much as everyone might think all there is to creating a bot is a sexy image and a willing character, it is more than that. Look at any of Sarah The Creator’s bots, and you will find there are stories being told around the sexy bits. So it is important to take a little time and think about your character. I have a guide which goes into more detail around using a character driven approach to your creation, but for here, let me try and sum up the process.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Before you start creating your character, think about them. Ask yourself some things about them. What is their background? What do they like and dislike? What do they want from life? Do they have a fatal flaw or amazing talent? What do they smell like? There are a myriad of questions you can ask. And it is easy to be impatient with this part of the creative process, but I encourage you to take the time. Why? Because it will make your character better in subtle ways. The more facts you can assemble, the more you will know the answers you will need to create your character’s personality, scenario, dialog, and reason for being. The more facts you can give the AI, the more the AI can build the character you envision and tell the story you want to tell.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            What happens if you don’t do this? Well then you put your character at the mercy of the AI to fill in the gaps you leave open. The AI is not a reliable narrator, it should be seen as a tool that brings the instructions you have to life. Other creators have information for you about creating personality sheets, or scenarios. But my part in this assembly of knowledge is to encourage you to create and breathe life into your character. Because even that poor woman stuck in the washing machine deserves to have a story. Have fun and be creative.

                        <h2>Description: by SmokingTiger</h2>
                        <p>
                            Descriptions should be treated like a blurb; the enticing snippet found on the back of a book that draws people to read it's contents. Much like a book's blurb, your character's description should contain one or more of these elements to help convince a user to click on your bot and try it out:
                        </p>
                        <h3>Hook:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Something that grabs their attention, intriguing the user with a question, a striking statement, or even a bit of mystery.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Example: <i>A cosmic entity presents itself, curious about you and the world you inhabit.</i>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Call to Action</h3>
                        <p>Ending the description with a compelling line that invites the reader to dive into the story, leaving them with a sense of anticipation.</p><br>
    
                        <p>
                            Example: <i>You spot an embarrassed country girl in your college campus café, trying to decipher the menu.</i>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Character introduction:</h3>
                        <p>
                            A brief and interesting introduction of the character. Highlighting a quirk, gimmick, or something unique and interesting about them.
                        </p><br>
    
                        <p>
                            Example: <i>Ayana Kando "The Tiger" is the most infamous delinquent in your local district. But after saving her from a gang of troublemakers, she's begun acting strangely around you.</i>
                        </p>
    
                        <h3>Setting or world:</h3>
                        <p>If the character's setting is unique or integral to the experience, a few words to paint a picture of the world can help hook a user to try them out</p><br>
    
                        <p>Example: <i>Welcome to Cafe Overtime. A tiny coffee bar that only opens in the little hours of the night</i></p><br><br>
    
                        <p>
                            It's important to take the length of your description into consideration.  Since this is the very first piece of writing any user will read, even before they click in to chat with your bot, having your description fully, or partially visible is integral.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Typically, on desktop, a character's description will show between 70-90 characters.  On mobile, it will show between 40-60 characters. Make sure your most enticing portions of your descriptions are visible! You can even use the limited visibility to your advantage by having the description run off, drawing a user to want to click into the character to finish reading your description.

                        <p>The personality section is where our characters live. This area is where physical attributes, personality traits, hobbies, pet peeves and all other key characteristics live.</p><br>
                        <p>When writing in this section include the basics of your character as well as any specific details you want them to have.  If the character has favorite hobbies, their nipples pierced, or really has a thing for clowns all that information will go into the personality section. Their height, hair color, size of specific body parts, unique body parts, and anything else physically about the character belongs in the personality section. </p><br>
                        <p>Additionally, what else makes the personality is the personality! Bold, confident, straightforward, and strong. These are all descriptive characteristics that a character can embody. This is also where that information should go.</p><br>

                        <h2>First Message: by x_Neversoft_x</h2>
                        <p>
                            The First Message is the most important section and is often the most overlooked aspect of bot development. In this section, you can set the scene, establish speech and thought patterns, and direct the flow of narration.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The engine (LLM) will reference the First Message before responding every time, so the formatting of the message should be consistent throughout the entire chat.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            You should establish the scene by providing a brief description of where you and/or the character are, including your surroundings, sights, and smells. Such sensory descriptions can help create a vivid picture for the user and the LLM.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Next, you will want to make your character speak. Whether through thoughts or direct speech, the way you establish their speech patterns should remain consistent with what is presented in this section. For example, if you want your character to speak like a pirate, you should provide examples here, and the LLM should follow that pattern (with some additional prompting in the Scenario section) throughout the chat. The same applies to inner thoughts; include them in this section and provide examples in the First Message.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Finally, this is where you can define the narration style the LLM should use. Consider whether the bot should think inwardly, express emotions in thoughts or descriptions, and whether you want the chat to read like a storybook. If you want your bot to think in the first person, you should establish that through the wording of the First Message. If you narrate like a storybook, the LLM will mimic that style throughout the chat. The choice of first, second, or third person is very important here.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Fortunately, First Messages are one of the most transparent aspects of any bot. Take the time to read through other authors' bots and see how they approached it. If you appreciate someone's style, you can likely adapt it to your own through careful study of their First Messages.
