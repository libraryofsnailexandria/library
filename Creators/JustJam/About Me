I'm an bot creator with a passion for crafting romantic narratives, particularly those featuring shy and delicate female characters. I always aim to add a unique touch to my bots, and I'm constantly experimenting with new ideas.

In my downtime, I enjoy spending time with my cat, working on my own video game project (it's a slow burn, but it's getting there), and exploring various forms of art. I'm always seeking new ways to express my creativity.

After midnight I am also known as Wizard Gooner Prime.
