# Style Guide

Formatting of Bot development guides is now normalized across the board, this will allow us to have a consistent presentation across the website and we will also be able to let a creator know to fix stuff in their guide if their formatting does not exactly make our life easy.

## Format Tags

We will be using the following tags to format, in rare instances we'd use other formatting if required:

```<h1>This is a Title</h1>, <h3>This is a sub-title</h3>, <p>Your average text</p>```

Those three tags will be our bread and butter, a less used one might be ```<pre>``` Which is a pre-formatted tag, in very difficult guide structures we might use this but it limits the amount of styling we can apply to a certain degree and the formatting in there is absolute, meaning you cannot put a Header inside of a Pre-Formatted tag.

Example uses:

```<h1>The Scenario</h1>``` - Titles, etc should use H1
```<h3>Writing Scenarios</h3>``` - Subtitles, Say you have "The Scenario" and within that part of the guide you have multiple different points the creator touches, each point starts with it's own sub-title, that's where H3 comes in.
```<p>Lorem Ipsum</p>``` - Your everyday text, nothing special, just text that is NOT a title xD.
